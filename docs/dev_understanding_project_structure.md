## Folder Purpose

### `docs/`
Developer guides such as getting started, seeding and data import.

### `packages/`
Holds publishable packages. Currently contains a placeholder `prisma-client` package.

### `prisma/`
Prisma ORM schema (`schema.prisma`) and seed scripts. The `seeds/` folder contains individual seeding modules used by `prisma/seed.ts`.

### `public/`
Static assets served directly by Next.js.

### `src/app/`
Next.js "app" directory. Pages and API routes live here.

- `(risks)` â€“ a route group for riskâ€‘related pages. It contains:
  - `risks/page.tsx` â€“ list view of risks.
  - `risks/new/page.tsx` â€“ form to create a new risk.
- `api/` â€“ serverless API endpoints backing the UI. Routes include `/risks`, `/risk-categories`, `/likelihoods`, `/consequences` and `/risk-levels`.
- `layout.tsx`, `page.tsx`, and `globals.css` â€“ the base layout, home page and global styles.

### `src/jobs/`
Utility scripts run outside the web app. Under `utils/ism-controls/` are scripts to fetch and import ISM control data.

### `src/modules/`
Reusable UI modules. The `risk` module exposes components (`columnPicker`, `riskTable`) and constants used by the risk pages.

### `src/server/`
Server-side helpers. Currently provides the Prisma database client.

### `src/shared/`
Code shared between client and server.

- `lib/` â€“ generic utilities such as `fetcher.ts` used by the front end.
- `prisma/` â€“ helper objects for Prisma queries (e.g., include definitions).
- `types/` â€“ TypeScript types for database entities and catalogs.
